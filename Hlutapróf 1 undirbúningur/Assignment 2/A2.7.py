# Kingâ€™s Island needs a program for its admission booths. When visitors to the park 
# come up to the booth to purchase their tickets, the worker uses this program to figure out
# how much to charge them.

# Each ticket cost $30. Senior citizens (age >= 65) are given a 50% discount. 
# Children under (or equal to) the age of 5 get a free admission.
# Write a program that prompts for the visitor's age and computes and 
# prints the ticket price (which should be a float).
